Dear ____, 

Thank you again for being part of the Program Committee in the first edition of Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS) in 2018. The workshop would not have been possible without your contribution https://nlposs.github.io/!

We have sent you an invite to the 2020 workshop but we haven't heard from you since our invitation. 

**Could we check with you whether you would like to continue to join us as a program committee (PC) member for the workshop in 2020?** Your experience with various NLP OSS is very valuable to the workshop that could be shared with the open source NLP communities.

We have kept the workshop proposal up to date on https://github.com/nlposs/NLP-OSS

As a committee member, you would help us to review paper and promote the workshop by encouraging submissions and circulating information.

Please do give us any feedback about the workshop if you have any. Or any concerns about commitment as a PC member.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Best Regards,
NLP-OSS Organizers
